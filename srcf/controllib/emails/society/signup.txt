Your new shared account '{{ target.society }}' is now live on the SRCF.  A link to this account has been added to your home folder.  Inside, you will find a public_html and a cgi_bin folder -- you can upload web content here, which will appear at the following address:

    http://{{ target.society }}.soc.srcf.net

(However, it may take up to 20 minutes between uploading a new site and it being published.)

The FAQ introducing the various services provided by the SRCF can be found here:

If you have any further queries, feel free to email the sysadmins.  Please also remember that the SRCF is a volunteer-run organisation which must ultimately rely on the generosity and support of its members.
