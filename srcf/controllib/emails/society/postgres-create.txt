A PostgreSQL database '{{ target.society }}' has been created for your shared account, at the request of {{ requester.name }} ({{ requester.crsid }}).

PostgreSQL username: {{ target.society }}
PostgreSQL password: {{ password }}

{% include "common/password-sharing.txt" %}

To access the database via a web interface (phpPgAdmin):

    https://www.srcf.net/phppgadmin

To access the database from the shell, use the following command:

    psql {{ target.society }}

Authentication is handled by the current shell user, so no password is required.
