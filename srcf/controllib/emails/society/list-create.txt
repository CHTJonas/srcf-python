The mailing list {{ listname }}@srcf.net has been created for your shared account, at the request of {{ requester.name }} ({{ requester.crsid }}).

List password: {{ password }}

{% include "common/password-sharing.txt" %}

To manage the list via a web interface (Mailman):

    https://lists.srcf.net/mailman/admin/{{ listname }}

Your list also comes with an information page where prospective members can join:

    https://lists.srcf.net/mailman/listinfo/{{ listname }}

We recommend you keep the list owner set solely to the unified society admin email address (though you may add additional moderators if needed).  This way, ownership of the list matches the rest of the society account.
