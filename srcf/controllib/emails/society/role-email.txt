A new role email address, {{ new_email }}, has been added to {{ target.society }}.

This acts as an additional point of contact if we're unable to get a response from the named account admins, or if the society account becomes orphaned.  However, this is not a replacement for timely handovers of the society -- please continue to ensure that the list of admins remains up-to-date, in order to avoid interruption of service.
