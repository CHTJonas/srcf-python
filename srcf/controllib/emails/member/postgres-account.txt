A PostgreSQL account '{{ target.crsid }}' has been created for you.

PostgreSQL username: {{ target.crsid }}
PostgreSQL password: {{ password }}

{% include "common/password-sharing.txt" %}

You can use this account to manage society databases to which you have access, for example '{{ database }}'.

To access databases via a web interface (phpPgAdmin):

    https://www.srcf.net/phppgadmin

To access databases from the shell, use the 'psql' command:

    psql -h postgres {{ database }}

Authentication is handled by the current shell user so no password is required.
