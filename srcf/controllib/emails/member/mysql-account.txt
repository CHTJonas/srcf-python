A MySQL account '{{ target.crsid }}' has been created for you.

MySQL username: {{ target.crsid }}
MySQL password: {{ password }}

{% include "common/password-sharing.txt" %}

You can use this account to manage society databases to which you have access, for example '{{ database }}'.

To access databases via a web interface (phpMyAdmin):

    https://www.srcf.net/phpmyadmin

To access databases from the shell, use the following command:

    mysql -u {{ target.crsid }} -p {{ database }}

You can change your MySQL password via phpMyAdmin or by issuing the following SQL command:

    SET PASSWORD = PASSWORD('new password');
