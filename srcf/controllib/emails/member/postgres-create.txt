A PostgreSQL database '{{ target.crsid }}' has been created for you.

PostgreSQL username: {{ target.crsid }}
PostgreSQL password: {{ password }}

{% include "common/password-sharing.txt" %}

To access the database via a web interface (phpPgAdmin):

    https://www.srcf.net/phppgadmin

To access the database from the shell, use the 'psql' command -- it will default to your personal database, and authentication is handled by the current shell user so no password is required.
